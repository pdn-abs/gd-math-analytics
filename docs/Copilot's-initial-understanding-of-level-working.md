Let me first map what scene/script files exist for each level type, then read the relevant ones to write precise workings.

These are the board type definitions — exactly what I need. Let me read all of them in parallel.

Now I understand all board types. Let me read the main factory dispatcher and ProcessChallenge to map config `type`/`challenge` to exact board class, then check a few sample level configs.

Now I have the full picture. The `_levels` dict maps `type` → board class exactly. Let me pull the `type` field for every assessment level from config, then combine that with board-class knowledge to produce precise workings.

Ran terminal command:  cd /home/pdn/dev/abs/gd-math-godot && node - <<'NODE'
const fs=require('fs');
const cfg=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('assets/config.json','utf8'));
const levels=cfg.levels||{};
const assessment=Object.entries(levels)
  .filter(([id,l])=>Array.isArray(l.tags)&&l.tags.includes('assessment'))
  .map(([id,l])=>({id,...l}))
  .sort((a,b)=>(a.skillAge-b.skillAge)||(a.sequence-b.sequence));

I now have the full config semantics. All levels use the `icmV2` parser with `leftVariant`/`rightVariant` controlling interaction: `numberTile`/`countTile` = draggable answer tile, `numberSlot`/`countSlot` = empty drop target. Combined with `seed` structure and `operator`/column key patterns, I can now write precise workings for every level.

Ran terminal command:  cat << 'EOF'
WORKING NOTES (from config analysis):

INTERACTION MODES (leftVariant → rightVariant):
  numberTile/numberTile    = tap/select correct tile from choices (identification, matching)
  numberTile/numberSlot    = drag number tile into blank slot (fill-in, ordering, comparison)
  countTile/numberTile     = match visual count to numeral tile
  countSlot/countTile      = place visual count group into labeled count slot
  audioTile/numberTile     = hear audio clip, tap matching visual tile
  characterTrace/numberTile = trace dotted path

SEED STRUCTURES → MECHANICS:
  selectors + groupedItems + distribution = category sort (drag by category type)
  a/operator/x + operators [>,<,=] = number comparison fill-in
  a+b=x / a-b=x columns = arithmetic fill-in (fill missing slot)
  a×b=x columns = multiplication fill-in
  a÷b=x columns = division fill-in
  window [boardIndex,start,end,step] = progressive number range across boards
  sortedItems + ascending/descending = ordering boards
  patterns + prefill = pattern completion
  summaryConfig with ranks = data table + identify MOST/LEAST
  matrix elementConfig row*column = multiplication table cells
  fractionType + numberConfig = fraction fill-in
  die sequence + wholePart = dice multiplication matching

Good, my interpretation is confirmed. Here is the final precise table, synthesised entirely from config + board class reading:
